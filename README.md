📝 Project Introduction: StudentProfile

The StudentProfile project is a React-based application designed to demonstrate the lifecycle of a component in a real-time scenario. It displays a student’s name, marks, and calculates their grade automatically based on the marks provided.

The project showcases how a component mounts, updates, and unmounts:

Mounting: Initializes the student’s grade when the profile first loads.

Updating: Automatically recalculates the grade whenever the marks change.

Unmounting: Cleans up resources when the component is removed.

This project uses React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) to replicate traditional class component lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. It is a practical example for understanding how React manages component state and reactivity in modern applications.
